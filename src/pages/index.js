      <p>Helping companies deliver real value across product design and development, by knowing that they are investing in designing right things. I work with teams, to understand the features that go into the products and make sure they actually solve the underlying customer and business problems. I guide teams to create more valuable design work through strategic design and lean UX practice.</p>

      <p>I help businesses through what the project means for them and their business. To create magic moments, that connects customers with the product or service to help them achieve an experience they desire. By running experiments to generate learnings to improve the product.</p>
